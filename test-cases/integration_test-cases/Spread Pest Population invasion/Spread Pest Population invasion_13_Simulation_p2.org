* Test Steps
  1. Click on the simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the simulation page
  3. Click on the simulator link 
  4. A new tab will be opened with simulation proces
  5. Don't give valid inputs in Length of habitat,Number of years,Establishment,Initial pest population Disperse Rate and Population Growth Rate fields of the variable box and click on the plot graph.
  6. To restart the simulation process click on the reset button.
